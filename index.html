    <p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif",style= "color: yellow;", > It is through the means of communication that I can share my 
        values, thoughts, beliefs, feelings, and experiences with 
        others. Face-to-face communication allows me to use both 
        verbal and nonverbal cues, making it the richest and most
        powerful form of communication. According to Dobkin and 
        Pace (2006), verbal communication consists of “messages 
        expressed through a formal language, using oral, written,
        or signed words” (p. 14). Nonverbal communications are 
        “messages expressed through symbols other than words, 
        including hand gestures, facial expressions, touching,
        vocal inflection, and clothing” (Dobkin & Pace, 2006, p.14). 
        The access to nonverbal cues in face-to-face communications 
        creates bonding and adds intimacy to my personal relationships. 
        Expressing love through touch or looking into someone's eyes 
        to display affection are examples of the power of nonverbal 
        communication. Additionally, nonverbal cues decrease chances 
        of misunderstanding in my interactions with others, and have a 
        vital role in expressing my feelings and perceiving emotions 
        in others.

    <h2 style="font-style: italic;"> Paragraph_2</h2>
    <p2 style="margin: auto;"> A strategy that nursing should use to help in the effort to 
        reduce health care cost inflation is quality improvement in 
        the form of prevention. This prevention onus is on every 
        nurse for eliminating all potential for injury due to medication errors. 
        A truly comprehensive improvement program for medication error prevention 
        can also reduce the risk of malpractice (Becher, 2001). Evidence is clear, 
        as seen in integrated care delivery systems, that reducing medication error 
        injuries has dramatically affected quality outcomes. Strategies for such improvement 
        are most effective if each nurse takes on the personal responsibility to work 
        and provide care with utmost ethics and safety. Mandatory continuing education 
        and regular skills checks and updates in places of employment help nurses to keep 
        functioning based on the safest and best standards.
